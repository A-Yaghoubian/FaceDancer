# FaceDancer
![demo_vid_0](133_to_4.gif)
## Abstract
>In this work, we present a new single-stage method for
>subject agnostic face swapping and identity transfer, named
>FaceDancer. We have two major contributions: Adaptive
>Feature Fusion Attention (AFFA) and Interpreted Feature
>Similarity Regularization (IFSR). The AFFA module is em
>bedded in the decoder and adaptively learns to fuse at
>tribute features and features conditioned on identity infor
>mation without requiring any additional facial segmenta
>tion process. In IFSR, we leverage the intermediate fea
>tures in an identity encoder to preserve important attributes
>such as head pose, facial expression, lighting, and occlu
>sion in the target face, while still transferring the iden
>tity of the source face with high fidelity. We conduct ex
>tensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on various
>datasets and show that the proposed FaceDancer outper
>forms other state-of-the-art networks in terms of identity
>transfer, while having significantly better pose preservation
>than most of the previous methods.
### TODO:
- [ ] Add complete code for calculating IFSR.
- [ ] Add code for all evaluation steps.
- [ ] Provide download links to pretrained models.
