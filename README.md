# FaceDancer
![demo_vid_0](133_to_4.gif)
## Abstract
>In this work, we present a new single-stage method for
>subject agnostic face swapping and identity transfer, named
>FaceDancer. We have two major contributions: Adaptive
>Feature Fusion Attention (AFFA) and Interpreted Feature
>Similarity Regularization (IFSR). The AFFA module is embedded
> in the decoder and adaptively learns to fuse attribute
> features and features conditioned on identity information
> without requiring any additional facial segmentation process.
>In IFSR, we leverage the intermediate features
> in an identity encoder to preserve important attributes
> such as head pose, facial expression, lighting, and occlusion
> in the target face, while still transferring the identity
> of the source face with high fidelity. We conduct extensive
> quantitative and qualitative experiments on various
> datasets and show that the proposed FaceDancer outperforms
> other state-of-the-art networks in terms of identity
> transfer, while having significantly better pose preservation
> than most of the previous methods.
